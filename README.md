# Phaaze Config File

A Yaml file style with JSON support.
I just made this because i wanted my config files to look like i want them, soooo yeah... duh

It suppose to be an easy to read syllable file, which contents can be easily imported into a python program,
Together with full JSON support in variable values.

## Background info
I actually just made this, because you can not add comments into JSON files, which i used a long time to store my configs.  
Or when i add temporal test values without deleting the others, retoring the "real" name might sometime gets confusing,
at least for me, maybe because Im dumdum? Who knows. But yeah that the reason.
